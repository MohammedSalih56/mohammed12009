 Cascading Style Sheets for short: CSS It is a formatting language for web pages concerned with the shape and design of websites, specially designed
 to isolate the formatting (colors - fonts - buttons ....) from the content of the written document (in HTML) and this applies to colors, font
 images and backgrounds that are used on the pages flexibly This technology is concerned with the overall appearance of web pages including color
 images and more It can be added to the page in several ways, the best of which is external inclusion by writing the css code in a separate file
 It has been developed to reach now to CSS3, to which several additions have been added that were not available in the previous version and were
 only implemented by GQuery. It was launched by the World Wide Web Association's Web Council, as a standard.
